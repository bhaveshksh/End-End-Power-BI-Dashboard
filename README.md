Add interactivity (tooltips, slicers, drill-downs).

5. Publishing & Sharing
Publish the report to Power BI Service.
Optimize which page opens by default (e.g., restarting at summary view).

6. Deployment & Maintenance (BAU Process)
Document refresh and update workflow.
Refresh data locally, then republish for stakeholders
